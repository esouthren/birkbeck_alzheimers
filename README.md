# Dissertation Code 

Entry point is `entry.py`

ADNI data should be in the `data/` directory but is not included due to access restrictions. Please see dissertation text for full details. 

This code processes multiple data sources and prepares them for modelling ingestion. 

We use three models and document their output:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
